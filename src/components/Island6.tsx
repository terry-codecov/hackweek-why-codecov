          Striving for 100% code coverage is debated among developers. While it
          ensures every line of code has associated tests, achieving it can be
          exhaustive and doesnâ€™t guarantee bug-free code. Instead, focus on
          building a testing culture: start by setting up coverage tools, share
          coverage data with commits, gradually raise coverage standards per
          commit, targeting 30% and later 80% overall coverage. Hitting 100% is
          optional but not necessary; emphasis should be on test quality over
          sheer coverage. This approach balances meaningful testing and code
          quality.{" "}
