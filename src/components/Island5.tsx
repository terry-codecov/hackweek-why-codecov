          Getting started with code coverage usually requires your codebase to
          have tests. If you donâ€™t have any tests, then you will have 0% code
          coverage. Most languages have their own tools to calculate coverage
          when a test suite is run. After you have added tests and decided on
          what tool to use, you can begin to collect coverage metrics.
          <br></br>Using a code coverage as a service tool, like Codecov, can
          help get that data back in front of your developers.
